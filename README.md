### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on personal data projects using skills in SQL, Pyhton, Excel and Power BI.

- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on projects to analyze, interpret and visualize data. Also, developing predictive models for businesses.

- âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not crunching numbers or designing data models, you'll often find me nose-deep in a book. Whether it's a classic novel, the latest non-fiction bestseller, or a research paper, reading broadens my perspective, nurtures creativity, and strengthens my problem-solving abilities. I also enjoy playing football and 8 ball pool.
